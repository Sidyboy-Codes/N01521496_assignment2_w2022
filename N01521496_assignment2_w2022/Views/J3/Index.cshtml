    <h2>Sumac Sequences</h2>
    <h3>What is Sumac Sequences</h3>
    <p>
        In a sumac sequence, t1, t2, .., tm, each term is an integer greater than or equal 0. Also, each term, starting with the third, is the
        difference of the preceding two terms. The sequence terminates at tm if tm−1 < tm. For example, if we have 120 and 71, then the sumac sequence
        generated is as follows: 120, 71, 49, 22, 27. This is a sumac sequence of length 5
