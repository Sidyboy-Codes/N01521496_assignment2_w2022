#### Problem Description

Diana is playing a game with two dice. One die has m sides labelled 1, 2, 3, ...m, The other die has n sides. Program will determine numbers of ways she can roll the dice to get sum 10

#### Input Specifications

User should input 2 number in given input field. 1st for number of sides for die 1, 2nd for number of sides for die 2. such that 1<=m,n<=1000.

#### Output

Output will be total number of ways dice can be rolled so that sum is 10.

Also grammar of sentence changes according to number of ways.

## J3 Task: Sumac Sequences

* This J3 task is from CCC 2011. [Reference](https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2011/index.html)

#### Problem Description

In a sumac sequence, t1, t2, .., tm, each term is an integer greater than or equal 0. Also, each term,
starting with the third, is the difference of the preceding two terms (that is, tn+2 = tn − tn+1 for
n ≥ 1). The sequence terminates at tm if tm−1 < tm.

#### Input Specifications

The input will be two positive numbers a and b, with 0 < b < a < 10000.

#### Output

The output will be the length of the sumac sequence given by the starting numbers a and b.

#### Example

Input: a = 120, b = 71.

Output: The Sumac Sequence length for given numbers is 5.
